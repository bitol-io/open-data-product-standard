# Open Data Product Standard (ODPS)

Welcome! 

Thanks for your interest and for taking the time to come here! ❤️

## Executive summary
This standard describes a structure for a **data product**. 

The bulk of the work is on Slack and [GitHub](https://github.com/bitol-io/tsc/blob/main/rfcs/0010-odps.md). We expect a first release early 2025.

Contributions are welcome!
